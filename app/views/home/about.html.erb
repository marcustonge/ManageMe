        <p>This site was created by Marcus Tonge for the 'Web Applications Development' module.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="underline">Extra information about admin accounts:</p>
        <p>Admin accounts are created using the rails console and updating a user's admin field to 'true'.</p>
        <p>You can not delete admin accounts using the web interface as that could be problematic (security issues etc.), so for my
  design I've made it so that you need to grant or revoke admin status using the rails console on the host machine.</p>
